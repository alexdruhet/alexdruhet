Hi, I’m [Alex Druhet](@alexdruhet),

I’m Web designer and developer from Toulouse, France. I run a small Web design studio called Listo Studio. 

Despite the trends, I work with good old php, staying focused on Symfony and Drupal. I'm also a seasoned front-end developer addicted to html and css stuff.

The presentations are done, thank you!
